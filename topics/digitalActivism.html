      <h1 class="title">Digital Activism</h1>
      <center><div class="content">
        <p>Digital activism is the use of social media, the internet, mobile
          devices, and other technology to aid in political or social change.
          Digital activism can be more specifically defined as social media
          activism, online activism, cyber-activism, and online organizing.
          Although these terms are all quite similar, they have a few distinct
          differences, with the main difference being whether or not the
          internet is being used for activism purposes (Joyce, 2010) Social
          media activism is a form of activism that has become popular with
          the widespread use of Facebook, Twitter, and other social media
          sites. With the help of social media, activists have a larger
          platform on which to spread awareness for their cause, gain support,
          and organize online. Digital activism can be forming Facebook groups
          or communities, tweeting using specific hashtags, sharing photos or
          posts related to political or social causes, or simply a like on
          social media. The following video is a “How-to” that describes how to
          become a digital activist and what it takes to be success in using
           digital activism.

         <p>To some, digital activism is ineffective and can be considered
           "armchair activism" or "slacktivism". In these situations, digital
           activism is seen as the easy way out and that true activism is done
           in person and makes a more significant difference. A common viewpoint
           is that “an online activist need only reach for their laptop and
           click a button to feel as though they are contributing to a cause”
           (Gowling, 2016). Is digital activism really enough to make a
           difference? When has digital activism been successful?
         </p>
         <p>One famous case of digital activism was the Arab Spring, which is
           a main focus of Muzzamil Hussain’s arguments. Arab Spring was a
           political uprising in the Middle East in 2011 demanding political
           reform, new government, and social justice. It was a political
           movement that gained its traction through the use of digital media,
           especially social media and Twitter (Amnesty International, 2016)
           In his 2013 book Democracy’s Fourth Wave?, Hussain looks at the
           Arab Spring and how digital media made a difference. He writes,
         </p>
         <p class="quote">“Democratization movements had existed long before
           technologies such as mobile phones and the internet came to these
           countries. But with these technologies, people sharing an interest
           in democracy built extensive networks, created social capital, and
           organized political action; virtual networks materialized in the
           streets. Brave citizens made their shared opposition to the
           authoritarian rule known, and digital media served as an
           ‘information equalizer’...allowing for both the telling of
           compelling stories and the management of all the small
           communications and logistics tasks that must happen if an uprising
           is to succeed (Seib 2008)” (Hussain, 2013)
         </p>
         <p>The use of social media and digital activism had a huge impact on
           the success of the uprisings and reform that was seen in the Arab
           Spring. Hussain argues that although it is hard to tell whether or
           not the uprising would have occurred had it not been for digital
           media, the movement was amplified and improved through the use of
           digital activism (Hussain, 2013). Overall, Hussain supports digital
           activism as a valid and useful form of activism that can make an
           impact on social change because it calls one’s networks into action
           to create real change.

         <p>Recently, digital activism has become a popular tool for activism
           in regards to equality in the United States. Some of the most recent
           forms of digital activism have been seen through the Black Lives
           Matter movement, the Standing Rock protests, the 2016 Presidential
           Election, and many more social movements and causes. Digital activism
           has become an important form of activism for the Black Lives Matter
           movement because it has united people from all over the United States
           as one. It has given many people a voice and a platform to share
           their thoughts, feelings, experiences, and spread their support for
           the cause. Activists have taken to social media to plan their
           protests, participate in protests or show their support from afar,
           or use it as a platform to share their own personal experiences.
           The Black Lives Matter movement has been very social media and
           digitally oriented. Without the use and support of social media,
           the Black Lives Matter movement could possibly have less widespread
           awareness, visibility, and support.
         </p>
         <p>Another current example of digital activism is the digital
           presence of the Standing Rock protests. While there are many people
           traveling to North Dakota to protest the Dakota Access Pipeline in
           person, a lot of the attention and support is coming through the use
           of digital activism on social media. Celebrities and people all over
           the United States are sharing their opposition to the pipeline and
           calling others to share their opposition as well. Social media and
           other digital platforms have been used to spread awareness about the
           pipeline and why activists are pushing back against it. Various
           protests and other calls to action have been organized through the
           use of social media in digital activism.The digital presence held in
           the Standing Rock protests is extremely important because it has
           called many people to action and has greatly raised awareness about
           the pipeline and the protests against it.

         <p>Digital activism was also heavily used in the 2016 Presidential
           Election. Throughout the election process, many people were ready
           to #FeelTheBern or share they were #WithHer. Candidates used their
           personal accounts as a way to directly address voters and communicate
           their campaign platforms. In turn, voters used social media and the
           internet to show their support for the candidates they were voting
           for. Digital activism has become a vital part of politics and gaining
           support for campaigns. Digital activism could also be seen in the
           2016 Presidential Election on Facebook by the promoted option of
           sharing that you had voted. By sharing you had voted, many hoped to
           inspire others to also get out and exercise their right to vote in
           the election. Digital activism can have a major impact on campaigns,
            politics, and democracy.
          </p>
          <p>Overall, there are many forms of digital activism that can make a
            real difference in social and political change. As technologies
            continue to develop, digital activism will likely continue to
            develop as well. Online activism is still relatively new compared
            to the physical activism that has been seen in various societies
            for centuries. The growing effect of digital activism has the
            potential to create real social and political change in the United
            States and around the world.
