        <h2>WHAT’S FOURTH WAVE DEMOCRATIZATION?</h2>
        <p>According to Hussain, “democratization movements had existed long
          before technologies such as mobile phones and the internet came to
          these countries. But with these technologies, people sharing an
          interest in democracy built extensive networks, created social
          capital, and organized political action; virtual networks
          materialized in the streets” (Hussain, 2013).
        </p>
        <p>In the past, democratization has been achieved in the “traditional”
          way, usually by war as a vehicle for mass mobilization (think WWII
          or the fall of the Soviet Union). However, as our world becomes more
          technological, democratization has, too. Fourth wave democracy is a
          result of <b>information and communications technology (ICTs)</b>. For all
          intents and purposes, we’ll think of ICTs as the internet and mobile
          technology. ICTs enable rapid mass mobilization, where online
          activism translates to real-world change. We are in the midst of
          the fourth wave; the internet is helping to democratize countries.

        </p>

        <h2>CUBA</h2>
        <p>The internet in Cuba has always been something widely discussed by
          the likes of Amnesty International, the US Government, and Human
          Rights Watch, to name a few. With one service provider
          (ETECSA Telecom) run by the Cuban government, access is completely
          state-controlled and something that until recently, no citizen could
          use. It’s no coincidence that in recent history, there hasn’t been
          any sort of wide-scale protest against the communist government under
          Raul Castro. In line with Hussain’s argument that digital platforms
          are necessary to democratize, Cuba’s lack of citizen and
          democratization is largely to blame on lack of internet access.
        </p>
        <p>First, some facts about the current state of internet in Cuba:
          <ul>
            <li>There’s only one telecom company (ETECSA), and it’s controlled
              by the government</li>
            <li>Less than 25% of Cubans have internet access</li>
            <li>Only 5% of households are connected</li>
            <li>The average internet speed is 4% of the US’s average</li>
            <li>Content is censored to exclude anything critical of the state,
              and all internet usage is heavily monitored
            </li>
            <li>Recently, 40 Wi-Fi hotspots have been installed around the
              country by the government, though it’s too expensive for many
              Cubans
            </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>American companies have made efforts to intervene and bring
          unrestricted access into Cuba. Google, in particular, has made some
          strides including a technology center in Havana. Morozov argued that
          our cyber-utopian ideals are marred by the assumption that the
          “…Internet favors the oppressed rather than the oppressor”
          (Morozov, 2011). The fact is, despite the regime’s apparent
          investment into net access for its citizens (see Wi-Fi hotspots),
          real progress will not be achieved until they lessen control or
          fall out of power (Elgan, 2016). With a government-controlled
          monopoly, price inflation, and rampant censorship, there’s not
          much outside companies eager to make a buck or do some feel-good
          humanitarian work can do.

        <p>There are some Cuban bloggers, like Yaoni Sanchez, who have started
          to speak out about life under the regime. However, because the digital
          platform is so tricky for those living that reality to gain access to,
           the majority of those hearing about it are outside of Cuba. In this
           sense, it’s almost like reverse digital activism, and relates back
           to Morozov’s critique of our cyber-utopian ideals. Those who are
           oppressed in this situation don’t even know any better thanks to a
           full-time slew of propaganda and limited media from outsiders
           (Morozov, 2011).
        </p>
        <p>So is Cuba an example of fourth wave democracy? Maybe. Presently,
          it seems as if the power of the internet is not enough to overtake
          the regime. However, the groundwork is laid and it’s undeniable that
          ICTs have started something, time will tell if these efforts are
          successful.

        <h2>MYANMAR</h2>
        <p>When Myanmar (then Burma) gained independence in 1948 from Britain,
          they enjoyed a brief period of democracy. However, the government was
          largely unsteady and a coup d’etat followed, replacing democracy with
          a socialist state under tight military control. Under the socialist
          regime, media was tightly controlled through legal measures:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The Printers and Publishers Registration: enacted in 1962</li>
            <li>Television and Video Law: enacted in 1985</li>
          </ul>
        <p>Together, these laws gave the government control over all newspapers,
          restricted the import of international media, and prolifically
          censored content.
        </p>
        <p>Over time, this lack of freedom and extreme censorship led to much
          opposition from the people of Burma. Most recently, in 2007, there
          were wide-scale protests against government repression and cruelty,
          called the ‘Saffron Revolution’ (named after the color of the monks’
          robes who participated in the protests). This ended with hundreds of
          deaths (the actual number is withheld by the government), countless
          injuries, and even stricter censorship and surveillance on all forms
          of digital media. This restriction was in response to the access of
          news online depicting the government’s action in the Revolution in a
          negative light. Thanks to the proliferation of digital media, mostly
          on a global scale outside of Myanmar, the world was attuned to the
          violence of the regime during the Revolution.
        </p>
        <p>Insights into The Saffron Revolution:</p>
        <iframe width="55%" height="463" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z1lmXnQldMY" >
        </iframe>
        <p>In 2010, the protests spurred a constitutional amendment enacting a
          democratic government. In 2011, the heavy restrictions on internet
          ceased. ‘Free’ media returned in 2012. However, similar to Cuba, only
          an elite 1% of citizens have stable access to the internet due to the
          high cost of SIM cards and unreliable connections. Even that 1% has
          very unstable access, so interconnectivity is very difficult. The
          affordance of information diffusion is severely hindered.
        </p>
        <p>No matter the amount of censorship, the return of media and internet
          has spurned dissent within Myanmar. Even during heavy censorship, in
          2007 the Saffron Revolution was a shining example of how government
          control efforts failed when those outside Myanmar and the elite
          within could get their non-governmentally controlled news through
          digital media. Due to the internet, there’s no way the government of
          Myanmar can have the absolute control they used to have over media.
          Though they’re trying. Despite the so-called freedom citizens now
          enjoy, there are several reports of journalists being arrested and
          other human rights violations by the government.
        </p>
        <p>There are several organizations, like the Myanmar ICT for Development
          Organization, pushing for social change within Myanmar. They use a
          mixture of digital content and print to spread their message to as
          many people as they can. Myanmar is at an interesting turning point
          and only time will tell if the power of the internet overcomes that
          of the government to achieve true democracy and freedom, thus truly
          having successful democratization thanks to digital media.
        </p>
        <h2>THE ARAB SPRING</h2>
        <p>The Arab Spring is widely-thought of as a successful digital
          campaign for fourth-wave democracy that brought about real change.
           Hussain cites the Arab Spring in support for his arguments on the
           power of digital activism.

         <p>The Arab Spring started in Tunisia when a young man set himself on
           fire in protest of a broken justice system. From this, protests
           erupted all over the country, thanks largely to blogs and text
           messages, which revealed to Tunisians that they all shared
           grievances; they had a common dissatisfaction with their government.
           Through video services like YouTube, texts, and social media,
           “people crafted strategies for action and a collective goal: to
           depose their despot” (Hussain, 2013). Citizens started to share
           videos and images showing how their leaders exploited their country,
           like one of the Tunisian president’s wife taking a private plane to
           go shopping by herself. When the government cracked down on social
           media, people relied on text messaging on its own. The protests grew
           and outside organizations like Anonymous stepped in. Former President
           Ben Ali soon fled Tunisia.
        </p>
        <p>This movement soon spread around the Arab World. In Egypt especially,
           with a very high rate of internet use and fluency, there were some
           of the largest protests ever seen against the country’s governmental
           corruption. Around the Arab World, citizens began sharing strategies
           between countries to help collective action be as successful as
           possible, learning from each other.
        </p>
        <p>Eventually, Egypt’s Mubarak was removed, Libya’s Gaddafi was
          assassinated by rebel fighters, Yemen’s Saleh fled the country,
          and Syria’s Assad was absorbed in civil war. All these countries
          made moves toward democracy with different measures including
          democratically-elected officials, wealth redistribution efforts,
          and legislative ability to pass laws.
        </p>
        <p>In the Arab Spring’s case, ICTs allowed people from very different
          countries with very different histories to share grievances and work
          together, globally and locally, to overthrow corrupt regimes. Because
          of new technologies, these very different countries became part of
          very similar narratives.
