        <h2>Censorship:</h2>
        <p>What is censorship?  According to the Global Internet Liberty
          Campaign, “Censorship is the control of the information and ideas
          circulated within a society” (What is Censorship?, Web).  Censorship
          is not a new concept.  It has been around since ancient times and
          every society has had customs, taboos or laws by which speech, dress,
          religious observance, and sexual expression have been regulated.
          Censorship is dealt with in many different ways around the world.
          For example, it is widely known the the United States first amendment
          allows Americans the right to freedom of speech.  North Korea on the
          other hand ranks among the most extreme in the world in terms of
          censorship.  According to the World Press Freedom Index in 2016,
          North Korea is ranked second to last in the world
          at 179.  A reason that North Korea is ranked at the bottom is all
          media outlets are strictly owned and controlled by the North Korean
          government.  The media dedicates a large portion of its time towards
          political propaganda promoting its leader Kim Jong-un (VOA News, Web).
          Speaking out against the government could potentially have you jailed.
          It is important to learn and understand how different countries
          throughout the world use censorship.
        </p>
        <h2>China’s Great Firewall:</h2>

        <p>A very well known example of a country that censors people is China.
          China has the largest population of citizens online.  There are 700
          million users on the internet.  China is 25% of the world’s total
          online population (Denyer, 2016).  Wired magazine has coined a name
          for China’s censorship of media and the internet as “The Great
          Firewall of China” (Denyer, 2016).  This firewall is responsible
          for blocking many western sites for example, Facebook, Twitter,
          Instagram, and most Google services.  There is an interesting way
          in which you can check to see if a website is blocked.  The website
          that provides this information for you is called Blocked in China
          which you can click on below to view.</p>
          <a href="http:///www.blockedinchina.net"><img src="../media/censorship1.png"></a>

          <p>How this “firewall” works is by blocking keywords from showing up in
          searches.  An example that the article “China’s scary lesson to the
          world: censoring the Internet works” uses is the events that took
          place in Tiananmen square in the late 1980’s.  If you search for
          Tiananmen tank man under this firewall, your search will weild no
          results. (Denyer, 2016).  They have other ways in which they censor
          information too.  “Some estimates say that the government employs
          roughly 100,000 people, hired both by the state and  private
          companies, to constantly monitor China's Internet” (Xu, Web).
          China also hires private companies to make sure what is being said
          online reflects what the government would want the people to think
          of it.
        </p>
        <h2>Networked Authoritarianism:</h2>
        <p>What is networked Authoritarianism?  According to Rebecca MacKinnon,
          “When an authoritarian regime embraces and adjusts to the inevitable
          changes brought by digital communications, the result is what I call
          ‘networked authoritarianism’” (MacKinnon, 33).  A good example of a
          networked authoritarian state is China.  In this networked
          authoritarian state, the government remains in control while a wide
          range of conversations about the country occur on websites and
          social-networking services.  The government gives the people a false
          sense of security when it comes to discussing political topics online.
          The government follows online conversations on social-networking sites
          and people call attention to problems about their government and
          sometimes they are able to have an impact on government policies.
          Other times people who are seen as threats are jailed for what they
          say online.
        </p>
        <h2>Morozov’s Take On Censorship:</h2>
        <p>Morozov has a very interesting take on censorship.
          “While we thought the Internet might give us a generation of
          ‘digital renegades,’ it may have given us a generation of
          ‘digital captives,’ who know how to find comfort online, whatever the
          political realities of the physical world. For these captives, online
          entertainment seems to be a much stronger attractor than reports
          documenting human rights abuses by their own governments”
          (Morozov, 70).  Morozov is suggesting that online entertainment
          “distracts” people from what is actually going on inside their
          country.  They find comfort in online entertainment and because of
          this they do not pay attention to political things that are going on
          in the country.  An example that Morozov brings up is countries who
          have previously banned people from viewing pornography have since
          allowed it.  China  quickly lifted their ban in 2009 after realizing
          that censorship was a way to politicize millions of Chinese Internet
          users (Morozov, 70).  Morozov goes on to explain that most of the
          blocked sites on the internet in countries such as China are political
          resources while leaving pornographic sites unblocked.  The main take
          away from his view on censorship is that governments are trying to not
          censor entertainment sites as they are a great way to distract its
          populace from ongoing political events that are occuring in
          the country.

        <h2>Hussain’s Example:</h2>
        <p>Another example of a networked authoritarian government would be
          Egypt.  Hussain talks about Egypt and how people were able to pass
          the censorship barriers.  A regional executive at Google started a
          Facebook group that was in remembrance of a blogger named Khaled Said.
          Khaled was beaten to death by the police in Egypt because of things
          that he had exposed on his blog about them.  The pictures of his
          beaten face were posted to this Facebook page and sent from phone to
          phone until it had reached thousands of people.  People began
          protesting against their government.  Not only for this but against
          the political ideologies of past leaders in Egypt.  The government
          then tried disconnecting its citizens from the internet which did not
          really work.  Tech savvy students found a way to get satellite phones
          and dial-up connections to other countries so they were able to still
          access the internet.  The government however tried using Facebook and
          Twitter as a source for a counterinsurgency strategy.  It was trying
          to predict where and when people would begin protesting.  This is an
          example of how the government was able to adjust quickly and follow
          online chatter about where certain groups were going to be protesting.
        </p>
        <h2>CONCLUSION:</h2>
        <p>It is important to understand how network-authoritarian governments
          use censorship in the modern age of the internet.  We need to
          understand how it works in different countries.  Censorship has the
          ability to potentially influence its citizens based on what has been
          censored.  It also important because you can potentially help people
          whose voice is not being heard because of this.  An example that I
          provided was from Hussain’s segment.  In Egypt, people were fed up
          with their government and their voice was being restricted so people
          stepped in to help them have their voices heard.  As we progress in
          the age of the internet, we need to understand the potential harms of
          censorship and how that is going to shape our society.
