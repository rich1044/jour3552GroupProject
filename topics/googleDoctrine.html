        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <p>In today’s society, “democracy” is a term known to most and a
          concept that is very familiar to the people of the United States.
          Over time, this idea of the government representing the people has
          become quite popular. But how has this idea spread throughout the
          rest of the globe? Is it as popular in other countries as it is in
          America? It is easy for Americans to want to share this type of
          government with other parts of the world, however it is easier said
          than done. The internet has allowed for the fast spread of ideas
          and communication amongst people from all over the world. Over time,
          democracy has been a hot topic as technology and social media have
          worked hand in hand to spread these ideas and particular stance to
          various regions; but has it been successful? This post will explore
          the concept of The Google Doctrine as coined by Evgeny Morozov,
          examples of how it has been shown in today’s society, and the issues
          that come with it.
        </p>
        <h2>WHAT IS THE GOOGLE DOCTRINE?</h2>
        <p>Technology and social media have rapidly become tools of
          communication for much of society over the past decade. It serves
          to quickly spread information, and allows for individuals to express
          their ideas and opinions on numerous topics. So how does this play
          into the idea of politics and democracy? It is quite easy for
          individuals to share a Facebook status or post a new tweet regarding
          various political issues. One could start a thread on Facebook on
          what they think of the last political debate or start a hashtag on
          twitter to discuss recent events in the Black Lives Matter movement.
           In The Net Delusion: The Dark Side of Internet Freedom, the Google
           Doctrine is described as, “...the enthusiastic belief in the
           liberating power of technology accompanied by the irresistible
           urge to enlist silicon valley start-us in the global fight for
           freedom” (Morzov, xiii). Essentially, the concept of the Google
           Doctrine sums up the perspective a lot of society has taken today
           in their use of the internet and networked politics. Social media
           has made it easy for individuals to use the sites or companies they
           are big fans of, as allies. In a way, they are teaming up with
           companies such as Facebook to express their opinions and spread
           their own personal ideas, in hopes that it will make a dent in
           this very large global society they are a part of.
         </p>
         <h2>EXAMPLES</h2>
         <p>How has this fantasized concept explained by Morozov been shown
           in the real world then? The idea of the Google Doctrine can shown
           up in numerous ways -- both subtle and direct. Often times large
           companies and their members, such as Facebook and Google, can be
           allies of democracy and society may not know it at all. With
           Facebook’s ever so complicated algorithms, it is easy for them to
           display certain types of news, and that includes ones that could
           favor on the side of democracy. In an article on the New York Times,
           Facebook’s capabilities are explained saying, “The question isn’t
           whether Facebook has outsize power to shape the world — of course it
           does, and of course you should worry about that power.” (Manjoo,
           "Facebook’s Bias Is Built-In, and Bears Watching."). With Twitter,
           simple hashtags are enough to spark discussions or even start large
           movements
         </p>
         <img src="../media/googleDoctrine1.jpg">
         <p>Although not about a specific political party, the simple hashtag #ElectionDay was
            able to garner about 27,000 tweets per minute in simply six short hours on the day
            of the 2016 presidential election (Gaudin, “In Presidential Campaign, Twitter was
            Powerful Political Tool.”). It is quite easy to see how easily this concept of the Google
            Doctrine can play out in modern day society, as even the smallest actions from both
            users of social media sites and the ones who work behind the scenes for them are
            able to spark a large scale revolution.
        </p>
        <h2>ISSUES WITH THE GOOGLE DOCTRINE</h2>
        <p>Similar with the concept of Cyber-Utopianism, believers of Google Doctrine fails to
          see the downside of enlisting large companies in spreading their political ideas and
          Beliefs. The Google Doctrine pairs quite well with the idea of cyber-utopianism
          which Morozov in The Net Delusion: The Dark Side of Internet Freedom describes as,
          “...a naïve belief in the emancipatory nature of online communication that rests on
          a stubborn refusal to acknowledge its downside” (xiii). The two concepts are quite
          complementary to each other, and can often go hand in hand. The Google Doctrine
          can often make it appear that the use of technology in spreading democracy comes
          with a lot less consequences than it actually does.

        <i><figcaption>Morozov discussing Cyber-Utopiniasm (2:25-3:32)</figcaption></i>
        <p>The enlisting of Silicon Valley in spreading political justice can quickly get quite
          messy and blurry -- for both the social media users and the workers of these
          companies. It can be difficult for companies to take a strong political sense -- and
          show it -- without getting into controversy in the public eye. Recently, Facebook got
          thrown into hot water when it was questioned whether they were one of those
          Silicon Valley allies that Morozov describes and if they were biasing their news feed
          Algorithm. The power of Facebook and other members of Silicon Valley’s abilities
          are described as saying, “More than 1.04 billion people use Facebook. It’s where we
          get our news, share our political views, and interact with politicians. It’s also where
          those politicians are spending a greater share of their budgets.” (Nunez, "Facebook
          Employees Asked Mark Zuckerberg If They Should Try to Stop a Donald Trump
          Presidency."). It is quite clear to see how enlisting Silicon Valley can quickly lead to
          murky waters. The actions of these companies in trying to promote the more
          freedom baring side does not always lead to a great outcome; more often than not
          it leads to more relationships confusion. Not to mention it can quickly lead to the
          obvious destruction of relationships between companies and certain groups of
          People. After this initial controversy, Mark Zuckerberg and the rest of Facebook
          quickly went to amend their relationship with users of the opposing side
          (conservatives) in fear that this would be harmful to the company. The breakdown
          of the meeting between Zuckerberg and other executives was described as, “...the
          group saying they felt conservatives did not have a true voice in the generally liberal
          area of Silicon Valley. To reassure attendees that Facebook is open to all
          perspectives, the company walked them through a technical presentation on how it
          surfaces the most popular news stories on the site.” (Isaac and Corasaniti, “For
          Facebook and Conservatives, a Collegial Meeting in Silicon Valley.”). Although the
          relationship was amended, could it have been in genuine interest in repairing the
          relationship with conservatives, or was it in interest of the company’s name and
          brand? This topic tends to be another downside in the concept of the Google
          Doctrine; it is never quite clear what the intentions of companies are when enlisting
          the help of Silicon Valley. In many ways, the Google Doctrine is often, seen as
          beneficial on paper, but not necessarily in practice.

        <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
        <p>Democracy has been quite monumental in the history of America. Throughout time,
          the introduction of technology and the internet has allowed for advancements in
          American society in a number of ways. Individuals are now able to communicate
          with virtually anyone around the globe, ideas can easily be shared with a click of a
          button, and discussions can quickly be sparked with a simple tweet. It is quite
          obvious to see how these advancements in American society can play a role in the
          spread of democracy around the globe. For Americans, the idea of spreading this
          type of government that can appear so common to them, but not to other
          countries that have yet to experience it, is easy. This belief can be summed up by a
          term called the Google Doctrine as coined by Evgeny Morozov. This idealistic belief
          at first may seem like a fool proof plan, but comes with many more implications
          and fine details than it appears. In conclusion, when approaching the idea of
          spreading one’s belief in democracy online, it is easy to see how there may not be
          very many implications that come with it; however, it is important to be aware of
          the consequences that come with this belief, and how it can affect not only users of
          the internet and social media, but also the companies that may also be enlisted in
          this plan.
