        <h2>BRINGING DEMOCRACY TO THE WORLD</h2>
        <p>Most people who have grown up in the United States would likely
          agree that a democracy is a wonderful form of government. Whether a
          person has different opinions of social justice issues or political
          policies, people are glad that they as an individual have the right
          to vote for the person who will support a majority of their personal
          opinions. Democracy has given power to the people, and allowed large
          amounts of freedom to this country, while maintaining a certain level
          of order beneath government rule. Unfortunately, not all countries
          allow for this kind of freedom.
        </p>
        <p>Many factors have contributed as well to the world‚Äôs modern ability
          to know what is happening in other parts of the world, but one of the
          biggest is the Internet. Not only has the Internet been able to allow
          people to connect socially, but people are able to know about wars,
          social issues, and other problems around the world. Because the
          Internet has had such a substantial impact on our society, there is
          a common misconception that the Internet has the ability to accomplish
          far more than it is capable. People who believe this may also believe
          in an idea called cyber-utopianism. Cyber-utopianism is not a concept
          that will effectively change governments in other non-democracy
          countries as it does not account for the political and cultural forces
          that are equally active in these countries.
        </p>
        <h2>INTRODUCING CYBER-UTOPIANISM</h2>

        </i>
        <p>There are multiple views on whether or not democracy can be spread
          through use of the Internet, and one specific author believes harshly
          against it. Morozov wrote about his term ‚Äòcyber-utopianism‚Äô in the
          introduction to his book, The Net Delusion: The Dark Side of Internet
          Freedom. The definition of cyber-utopianism is ‚Äúa na√Øve belief in the
          emancipatory nature of online communication that rests on a stubborn
          refusal to acknowledge its downside‚Äù (Morozov xiii). With this
          mindset, a person may believe that if only we were able to bring
          consistent internet use to areas of the world with oppressive
          authoritarian government, then the people would be able to accomplish
          social movement and change toward democracy.
        </p>
        <p>The issue with this idea is that it does not take into account that
          a country is much more than a group of people living in the same place
          that is easily able to be influenced by adding new communication and
          technology. ‚ÄúWesternizing‚Äù a people. There is an intricate culture
          that has developed over many years. There is a sociological aspect,
          the way that a society functions and the people‚Äôs willingness to
          take action toward change. And there is the political rule of a
          country which is able to maintain control through predictive powers
          and preventative measures
        </p>
        <h2>INTERNET GIVES POWER TO AUTHORITARIAN RULE</h2>
        <p>With the invention of the Internet, authoritarian governments have
          been able to change their systems in order to use digital tools to
          help them solidify their regimes. Morozov described this as such,
          ‚Äúcyber-utopians did not predict how useful it would prove for
          propaganda purposes, how masterfully dictators would learn to use it
          for surveillance, and how sophisticated modern systems of Internet
          censorship would become‚Äù (Morozov xiv). The Internet became not only
          a tool for allowing the spread of information to ask for help and seek
          for revolution, but the power that the government already held
          extended to more aspects of control.
        </p>

        <p>The Washington Post published an article that described the current
          situation in China. Denyer described the government‚Äôs control on the
          internet as the ‚ÄúGreat Firewall‚Äù of China. China has achieved a level
          of censorship that prevents a majority of the citizens to not be able
          to search certain items or reach ideas outside the bounds of the
          government of their country. The internet definitely exists there,
          with 700 million users, but these users do not have freedom and are
          not able to create change using the internet. The population is given
          ‚Äúfreedom,‚Äù but not truth. ‚ÄúIt can communicate with the outside world,
           meanwhile Western opinion cannot easily penetrate as ideological
           tools‚Äù (Denyer). Authoritarian control has easily been able to
           control the possibility of revolt from the internet, and therefore
           it does not have the ability to entirely free a country from
           oppression.
        </p>
        <h2>TWITTER SPREADS AWARENESS OF OPPRESSION</h2>
        <p>This does not suggest, however, that the internet has absolutely no
          power in creating freedom in a society. The New York Times were
          creating a documentary about the progress that has been made for
          women in Saudi Arabia. They recently have been given the right to
          vote in this extremely patriarchal society. Culturally, women living
          in this society live beneath a guardianship. This means that whatever
          man is considered the leader within their family, they are forced to
          ask for his permission in order to do anything, even as simple as
          working or spending time with friends. The way that the New York
          Times was able to learn about this was not through an interview.
          Saudi Arabia has one of the highest ratings for number of Twitter
          users (El-Naggar). The women were able to get out their stories
          through Tweets with the hashtag ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Tell the New York Times.‚Äù An
          example of this was featured in the article:
        </p>
        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">

        <p>There was a large variety of stories describing different ways that
          the women have been oppressed by living under this cultural
          oppression, but some women also shared stories of ways that they have
          benefitted from this society because of the good men in their lives
          (El-Naggar). Even if this specific movement did not create change, it
          did create some awareness. But how far will awareness take a movement?
          Yes, now people of the United States are now able to have an insider
          view into a culture, but will there be change?
        </p>
        <h2>THE APPROACH</h2>
        <p>In certain capacities the internet is able to create some change,
          though not quite at the levels that cyber-utopians seem to believe.
          Cyber-utopians may consider the above story as a major success, but
          the United States would not be able to create change from viewing a
          few Tweets. Morozov ironically wrote in his book, ‚Äú‚Ä¶let them tweet,
          and they will tweet their way to freedom‚Äù (xii).
        </p>
        <p>Contrastly, two authors, Howard and Hussain, have a far greater hope
          in the powers of the internet. One aspect that they realistically
          assess is the fact that it is important to view possibilities of
          change through the lens of all aspects of a specific country. They
          write, ‚ÄúWe seek to compare social movement activities and political
          outcomes within the region, within the current temporalities of
          technological and technocratic change‚Äù (Howard and Hussain 12). Each
          country of the world is vastly different demographically, culturally,
          politically, socially, etc. Within each region there is a unique group
          that each authoritarian government can adapt to the changes of the
          future. In Iran there has been a large amount of Westernization
          resulting from capitalism, industrialization and modernization
          (Jafari 367). Globalization has not changed the government of Iran,
          who still is ruled without democracy.
        </p>
        <p>Any belief that bringing American culture to other parts of the world
          is linked to a cyber-utopian idea, ‚ÄúSuch a laissez-faire approach to
          democratization has proved rather toothless against resurgent
          authoritarianism, which has masterfully adapted to this new, highly
          globalized world‚Äù (Morozov xi). Although more globalization has
          occurred and people should not take on the idea of
          digitial-defeatism‚Äîa term from Morozov‚Äîwhich could prevent any change
          from occurring, there are still many aspects to consider when
          approaching revolution.
        </p>
        <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
        <p>Democracy has been useful in the past in the United States and other
          countries in creating a country that a majority of the people agree
          should be leader. Though not everyone may agree with the leadership,
          in general, the most-wanted candidate will come to power and hopefully
          act in a way that is best for their country. Globalization and the
          spread of Western culture in different countries is closely related
          to the spread of the internet, though the internet is often given more
          credit than it is due or believed that it can create more change that
          it is capable.
        </p>
        <p>In efforts toward creating societies in which people are not
          oppressed under authoritarian rule, the internet may be a useful
          tool, but it is not the sole solution. The solution will be found
          once people are able to account for all the important factors that
          influence the politics and culture of a society and can realistically
          think about what can be done to influence change, which may in fact
          include the internet.
