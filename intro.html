        <p class="introP">In today’s highly-technological world, the internet has immense
          power to change the world for the better. Or so we think. There are
          those who support the internet as a tool for social and political
          change, and those who are critics. </p>

        <p class="introP">Evgeny Morozov argues that we have a “naïve belief in the
          emancipatory nature of online communication that rests on a stubborn
          refusal to acknowledge its downside” (Morozov, p. xiii). One of
          Morozov’s main arguments is <b>cyber-utopianism</b>: we assume that the
          internet favors the oppressed rather than the oppressor, but in
          actuality that doesn’t always hold. An offshoot of this is the <b>Google
          Doctrine</b>: that the ‘liberating power of technology’ is overstated and
          doesn’t help the fight for democracy or human rights. In a nutshell,
          Morozov argues the <b>net delusion</b>: that we believe too much in the power
          of technology to democratize our world and help the oppressed. It’s
          important that we don’t focus on the internet but rather local
          action. </p>

          <p class="introP">On the flip side, Muzzamil Hussain believes in the power of
            technology to fuel <b>Fourth Wave Democracy</b>; the internet’s power to
            connect people globally and anonymously gives way to real-world
            change. Digital activism empowers communities to raise awareness
            online, which transfers directly to demonstration and change in the
            ‘real world.’ </p>

          <p class="introP">Our site explores topics and arguments of both Morozov and Hussain,
            and how their topics play out in the real world. We hope you find it
            interesting and informative, and learn something new.</p>
